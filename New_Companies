/*
Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy: 
Founder
   |
Lead Manager
   |
Senior Manager
   |
Manager
   |
Employee

Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

Note:

The tables may contain duplicate records.
The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.
